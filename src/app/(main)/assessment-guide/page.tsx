              The rapid demographic shift towards an older global population has
              created an urgent and unprecedented demand for a healthcare
              workforce equipped with the specialized knowledge and skills to
              care for older adults. This necessity has catalyzed the evolution
              of geriatric medicine from a niche subspecialty into a core
              component of modern healthcare education. This foundational
              section will define the core tenets of the discipline, introduce
              the standardized frameworks that guide curriculum development, and
              map the continuum of competencies required across the spectrum of
              healthcare training.

                    Geriatric care education is built upon a distinct
                    philosophical and clinical foundation. It focuses on
                    improving health, preserving independence, and enhancing
                    quality of life. This requires a paradigm shift from a
                    single-disease model to a holistic approach that embraces
                    complexity and prioritizes patient-defined goals.

                      <strong>Aging is not a disease:</strong> This principle is
                      critical for combating ageism and preventing the common
                      pitfall of dismissing treatable symptoms as inevitable
