                  Palliative care is a specialized type of medical care that focuses on providing relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness. The main goal is to improve the quality of life for both the patient and their family.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>It's not the same as hospice.</strong> Palliative care can be provided at any age and at any stage of an illness, and it can be given alongside curative treatments like chemotherapy or dialysis. It's an extra layer of support that works with your loved one's other doctors.
