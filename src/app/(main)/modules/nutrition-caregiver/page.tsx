                  Malnutrition means an imbalance of nutrients. In older adults, it usually means "undernutrition"â€”not getting enough calories, protein, or other nutrients needed to keep the body healthy. It's a serious issue linked to more frequent hospital visits, falls, and other negative outcomes.
